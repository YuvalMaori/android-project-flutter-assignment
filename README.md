1. The class is used to implement the controller pattern in snapping_sheet library is
SnappingSheetController. it allows the developer to control the the sheet in multiple ways
(snapToPosition, stopCurrentSnapping, setSnappingSheetPosition), and also extract information from
the sheet (currentPosition, currentSnappingPosition, currentlySnapping, isAttached).

2. The parameter which controls the bottom sheet to snap into position with various different
animations is snappingPositions.

3. The main difference is GestureDetector provides more controls like dragging etc. on the other
hand it doesn't include ripple effect tap, which InkWell does.
